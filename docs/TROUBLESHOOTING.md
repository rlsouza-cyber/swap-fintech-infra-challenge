# Troubleshooting Guide for Fintech Platform

This document outlines common issues that may arise while deploying and running the fintech platform, along with troubleshooting steps and solutions.

## 1. Database Connection Issues

### Symptoms
- Application fails to connect to the PostgreSQL database.
- Error messages indicating connection timeouts or refused connections.

### Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Check Security Groups**: Ensure that the security group associated with the RDS instance allows inbound traffic from the EKS cluster's security group.

2. **DNS Resolution**: Verify that the application can resolve the RDS endpoint. Use tools like `nslookup` or `dig` from within the pod.
3. **Connection Pooling**: Ensure that the connection pool settings in the application are configured correctly to avoid exhausting the database connections.
4. **Timeout Settings**: Review and adjust timeout settings in the application configuration.

### Solutions
- Update the security group rules to allow traffic from the EKS nodes.
- If DNS resolution fails, check the VPC settings and ensure that the RDS instance is in the same VPC as the EKS cluster.
- Adjust connection pooling settings in the application to optimize database connections.

## 2. Pod Crash Loop

### Symptoms
- One or more pods are continuously crashing and restarting.

### Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Check Pod Logs**: Use `kubectl logs <pod-name>` to view the logs of the crashing pod.

2. **Describe Pod**: Run `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>` to get detailed information about the pod's state and events.

3. **Resource Limits**: Ensure that the pod has sufficient CPU and memory resources allocated.

### Solutions
- Analyze the logs to identify the root cause of the crash (e.g., unhandled exceptions, missing environment variables).
- Adjust resource limits in the deployment manifest if the pod is being killed due to resource constraints.

## 3. Performance Degradation

### Symptoms
- Increased latency in API responses.
- Slow database queries or timeouts.

### Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Monitor Metrics**: Use Prometheus to monitor application and database metrics.

2. **Profile Application**: Utilize APM tools to identify bottlenecks in the application code.

3. **Network Latency**: Check for network latency between services using tools like `ping` or `traceroute`.

### Solutions
- Optimize database queries and add appropriate indexes.
- Refactor application code to improve performance based on profiling results.
- Consider scaling the application horizontally by increasing the number of replicas.
