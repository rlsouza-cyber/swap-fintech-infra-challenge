# Fintech Platform Architecture Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the architecture of the Fintech Platform, which is designed to process financial transactions securely and at scale. The architecture leverages cloud-native technologies, including AWS services, Kubernetes, and Crossplane for infrastructure management.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Infrastructure Layer
- **VPC**: A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is provisioned to isolate the application and its resources.
- **Subnets**: The VPC includes both public and private subnets to enhance security and manage traffic effectively.
- **EKS**: Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) is used to orchestrate the microservices, providing scalability and management of containerized applications.
- **RDS PostgreSQL**: A Multi-AZ RDS PostgreSQL instance is utilized for high availability and data persistence.
- **ElastiCache Redis**: Redis is employed for caching and session management, improving performance for frequently accessed data.
- **Application Load Balancer**: An ALB is configured to distribute incoming traffic across the microservices.
- **Route 53**: AWS Route 53 is used for DNS management, ensuring reliable access to the services.
- **Secrets Manager**: AWS Secrets Manager is integrated for secure management of sensitive information such as database credentials.

### 2. Application Layer
- **Transaction API Service**: 
  - Implemented in [chosen language, e.g., Python with FastAPI].
  - Exposes endpoints for creating and retrieving transactions.
  - Utilizes PostgreSQL for data storage and Redis for caching.
  
- **Notification Service**: 
  - Implemented in [chosen language, e.g., Node.js with Express].
  - Handles notifications related to transactions and retrieves user-specific notifications.
  - Shares the same PostgreSQL instance but operates on a separate schema.

### 3. Communication
- **Service Discovery**: Kubernetes native service discovery is utilized for communication between microservices.
- **Ingress Controller**: An Ingress resource is configured with SSL/TLS termination to secure traffic to the services.
- **Webhooks**: The Transaction API sends webhooks to the Notification Service upon transaction creation.

### 4. Observability and Monitoring
- **Prometheus and Grafana**: These tools are set up for metrics collection and visualization, allowing for real-time monitoring of application performance.
- **Logging**: An ELK stack or Fluentd is implemented for log aggregation and analysis.
- **Custom Metrics**: Metrics specific to the fintech domain, such as transaction rates and notification latencies, are collected and monitored.

### 5. Security
- **Network Policies**: Kubernetes NetworkPolicies are configured to restrict traffic between services, enhancing security.
- **RBAC**: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is implemented to manage permissions for different components of the application.
- **HTTPS**: All communications are secured using HTTPS to protect data in transit.
