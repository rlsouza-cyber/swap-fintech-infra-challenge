# Fintech Platform

This repository contains the infrastructure and application code for a cloud-native fintech platform built using Crossplane, Kubernetes, and AWS services. The platform is designed to process financial transactions securely and at scale.

## Project Structure

- **crossplane/**: Contains configurations for provisioning AWS resources using Crossplane.
  - **providers/**: AWS provider configurations, including IAM roles and permissions.
  - **compositions/**: Custom compositions for provisioning the infrastructure stack (VPC, EKS, RDS, ElastiCache, etc.).
  - **xrds/**: CompositeResourceDefinitions (XRDs) specifying parameters for the fintech platform.
  - **instances/**: Instances of the defined compositions for actual resource provisioning.

- **k8s/**: Kubernetes manifests and configurations for deploying the application.
  - **namespaces/**: Namespace configurations for isolating components.
  - **apps/**: Contains manifests for the microservices.
    - **transaction-api/**: Manifests for the Transaction API service.
    - **notification-service/**: Manifests for the Notification Service.
  - **monitoring/**: Configurations for monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana).
  - **security/**: Security configurations (NetworkPolicies, RBAC).

- **docker/**: Dockerfiles and related files for building the microservices.
  - **transaction-api/**: Dockerfile for the Transaction API service.
  - **notification-service/**: Dockerfile for the Notification Service.

- **docs/**: Documentation files.
  - **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Architecture documentation with diagrams and component explanations.
  - **DEPLOYMENT.md**: Instructions for deploying the application and infrastructure.
  - **TROUBLESHOOTING.md**: Common issues and troubleshooting steps.
  - **API.md**: API endpoint documentation for the microservices.

- **scripts/**: Automation scripts for deployment and testing.
  - **deploy.sh**: Script to automate the deployment process.
  - **test.sh**: Script to run tests on the deployed services.
  - **cleanup.sh**: Script to clean up resources created during deployment.

- **drawio/**: Contains the architecture diagram in XML format for use with draw.io.
  - **architecture.xml**: Architecture diagram file.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have the following installed:
   - Docker
   - Kubernetes (kubectl)
   - Crossplane CLI
   - AWS CLI

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fintech-platform.git
   cd fintech-platform
   ```

3. **Configure AWS Credentials**: Set up your AWS credentials to allow Crossplane to provision resources.

4. **Deploy Infrastructure**:
   - Navigate to the `scripts` directory and run:
     ```bash
     ./deploy.sh
     ```

5. **Deploy Applications**:
   - Apply the Kubernetes manifests located in `k8s/apps/`.

6. **Access the Services**: Use the Application Load Balancer URL to access the Transaction API and Notification Service.

## Architectural Decisions

- **Microservices Architecture**: The platform is designed using microservices to ensure scalability and maintainability.
- **Crossplane for Infrastructure Management**: Crossplane is used to provision and manage AWS resources declaratively.
- **Kubernetes for Orchestration**: Kubernetes is utilized for deploying and managing containerized applications.

## Challenges Faced

- **Resource Provisioning**: Ensuring that all AWS resources are provisioned correctly with the right permissions.
- **Service Communication**: Implementing effective communication between microservices while maintaining security.

## Solutions Implemented

- **IAM Roles**: Configured IAM roles with the principle of least privilege for Crossplane.
- **Service Mesh**: Implemented a service mesh for better service discovery and communication.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a complete cloud-native fintech platform using modern technologies and best practices. For more detailed information, refer to the documentation files in the `docs/` directory.
